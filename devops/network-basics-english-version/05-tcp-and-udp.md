# 5. TCP and UDP

## 5.1 Transport Layer: TCP and UDP

### 5.1.1 TCP vs UDP Comparison

| Feature | UDP | TCP |
|---------|-----|-----|
| **Connection** | Connectionless | Connection-oriented (3-way handshake to establish, 4-way to terminate) |
| **Reliability** | No guarantee of delivery or order | Guaranteed delivery with correct order |
| **Latency** | Low latency, fast transmission | Higher latency due to acknowledgment and retransmission |
| **Data Size** | Small data, high-frequency transmission | Large data transmission |
| **Use Cases** | Gaming, voice calls, live streaming, DNS, IoT | File transfer, web browsing, email, payment, remote login |
| **Requirements** | Low latency, high real-time requirements | High data integrity, acceptable delay |

### 5.1.2 Connection Analogy

- **TCP (Phone Call)**: Connection-based and reliable
  - Call must be connected first
  - Two-way communication
  - Hang up when finished

- **UDP (Text Message)**: Connectionless and unreliable
  - Did the recipient receive it?
  - Is the content complete?
  - Unknown network conditions
